# Introduction

At some point Game Developers will need to ask for a license, will have a contract in their hands, will want to create their own studio, protect their own intellectual properties, etc. I'll try to clarify and give some education about legal issues we may encounter at some point, so we can actually understand a little bit what's going on with the legal side of Game Development.

Companies and why are they useful will be our first topic. The second topic will introduce the most common contracts in our industry. The third topic will be about Intellectual Property (IP). The fourth topic will teach how to handle infringement on Intellectual Property Rights. The Fifth topic will be on Privacy Policies and why are important. The Sixth topic will be a list of Available Licenses (free) useful for Game Developers. Finally we will have a summary with the most important concepts to take away. Bibliography and references at the bottom as well.

# Creating a Company

*By that meaning a **legal corporate entity**, not a group of people (with high ego) that call themselves a studio...*

* A company should be created **before you start working/developing anything** IDEALLY (It’s not like absolutely mandatory…). 

* It could wait until getting serious about a project, starting investing money and/or a lot of time (common thing to do).

* It should not be delayed any further than when you **start/want/have to work with others**.

“A company is sort of like the legal equivalent of a suit of power armor, it protects you and gives you cool abilities.” | *Chris Reid*

* Some "Abilities" of a company (of your highest interest):

  * **Intellectual Property container**: it acts like bucket for IP, which is very convenient. That means that the rights of every part of the game and the game itself can be assigned to the company. All the rights are in one place and then can be licenced to other if needed.
  * **Limited Liability**: meaning that the problems that may appear (debts is a good example) will stick to the company and not to the developer/s. It can "tank" the risk for you.
  * **Handle ownership**: which part is owned by the members (if there’s more than one) and how to distribute the revenue will have to be specified. The type of entity type the company is will have to be decided (Types [here](https://venturefounders.com/business-entity-types/) and in Spanish [here](http://www.econosublime.com/2018/12/tabla-tipos-empresa-segun-forma-juridica.html).

  * **Seriousness**: other companies or businesses will prefer to deal with other companies.
  
* Doing the **paperwork** so the government can **recognise** the **legal entity** and paying some fee will enable the company to **open a bank account, start doing contacts**. 

* Is very important as well to have **in paper all the ideas and decisions** with a "shareholders agreement/Draft Operating" so everything is **nice and clear**.

# Contracts

”A legal document that states and explains a formal agreement between two different people or groups, or the agreement itself.” | *Cambridge Dictionary*

“Acts like a rulebook where people can go and see what the rules are and how it works.” | *Chris Reid*

* A **protection** against the **worst case** and also the **best case** scenario. Things can go wrong so is good to have everyting written in paper, but also things can go right and is also good to have them. Having a well written contract will **prevent** any complaints of the contributors to the game. 

* Contracts should be done **before doing anything to anyone**. 

* Contracts are **needed to transfer IP rights** (both giving and receiving).

* **Contracts don't enforce themselves**. Having the "rules" written doesn't mean they are going to be followed so "no fuss, no muss".

* Generic clauses contracts have (before we get in more detail):
 
  * **Time of performance**: the duration/termination, how long will it last or when it will finish.
  
  * **Indemnification/Warranties**: the promises and what will happen if they are not accomplished.
 
  * **Compensation**: everything related to money, when, how, how much…
  
  * **Services/Deliverables**: What the contractor gives and what the contracted gives. 
 
  * Other common clauses in contracts [here](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/common-clauses-in-a-contract.html).

## Types of Contracts
The most common in our industry.

### License Agreements

* **Between** someone that owns a license (**licensor**) and someone who is authorized to use it (**licensee**).

* They **transfer IP rights**.

* Having a license of IP rights may permit you develop/create, sell/distribute.

* What to specify:
  * **Definition**: what is being licensed.
  * **Duration**: for how long.
  * **Permitted uses**.
  
### Non Disclosure Agreements
_(NDAs)_

* **Between** someone telling confidential information and someone receiving it (also named contract of confidentiality).

* **When** doing interviews, game pitches or if you happen to work on a **confidential** project.

* They are **the only way** to protect what copyright can’t (IDEAS/MECHANICS), or non-public info.

* What to specify:
  * **One way/mutual.**
  * **Definition of “confidential”** (What it is, what extent).
  * **Permitted uses**.
  * **Duration**.
  * **Obligations**: protocol to follow.
  * **They can say “No”** obviously then no info shared.

### Work for Hire Agreements

* **Between** **developer** and contracted** (someone about to do something for you).

* This agreement is what **gives the IP rights** to the hiring **company/studio**.

* Very important to **be clear** so there no disasters.

* What to specify:
  * **Ip rights are from contractor**: can be licensed if contracted wants them (for example portfolio).
  * **Payments**: How? Rev share (SPECIFY IT AS DEEP AS POSSIBLE, steam cut, publisher cut, multiplatform, sequel/dlcs).
  * **Amount of Work**: the quantity/scope of work, very clear as well.
  * **Time of performance/Termination**: how long. The right to end the contract and what happens.
  * **Indemnification/Warranties**: the promises and what happens if not respected.

### Development Agreements 

* **Between** a client or **funder** and the **developer** (when a studio makes a game for someone else, they get hired).

* **Ensures payment**.

* **Sets how much work**.

* What to specify:
  * **Ip rights**: they will be for the contractor. You should aim always to not give those rights until they pay you what was accorded. And also reclaim what is called “developer tools” for example code libraries, engines, that you may want to use for other games in the future. so make sure those rights are not given, instead licensed so they can’t reclaim them or even reverse engineer.
  * **Payment**: clear what, how, when.
  * **Amount of work**: very clear (GDD) what features, how many. And specify what happens if they make you do more than accorded. Change orders should be the way to go so they have to sign. 
  * **Termination**: be able to get out of a bad deal, to claim what is owed. And also if the client can break the contract for convenience, if you will get a kill fee, or paid until the last milestone so you are not left out on the street without pants.
  * **Indemnification/Warranties**: often promising that the game will be entirely free of any infringing material. Be careful with hidden easter eggs that they not may like.

### Publishing Agreements

* **Between** a **publisher** and a **developer** (publisher funder/publisher hired).

* Although **a publisher might not be needed** the agreement will be needed if it is.

* What to specify:
  * **Ip rights**: make sure you are licensing them to sell the game not giving them the rights (the game basically) and that there’s not any trick (if you are late they own it or some shit). And also that there’s details on that license you are giving (how long, how abroad geografically, which platforms, and which products: sequels,DLCs, even merchandising).
  * **Payment**: again the usual is rev share. make shure is very detailed and that every % is reasoned. And be careful with recoupable expenses (the publisher gets paid first what they invested).
  * **Obligations**: Publish and promote the game is not enough, dig deeper (money, marketing plan, time, location, how, etc.).
  * **Termination**: If you are not okay with the work of the publisher, you may want to terminate the contract or limit the time and ask for a minimum revenue condition.

### End User License Agreements
_(EULAs)_

* **Between** the **developer** and the **players**.

* **Before** anyone downloads or **play** the game, even for beta.

* **Control** our **responsibility** by imposing **obligations on players**.

* Disclaimers about issues the user may have. For example medical(epilepsia/heart attacks), or if the PC gets on fire.

“Any rights the publisher licenses to the end user must be appropriately defined as those rights you have previously licensed to the publisher in the publishing agreement.” | Coe, T. Wright Hassall.

* **Make sure they have to click “Accept” before they can play.**

* What to specify:
  * **It’s a license agreement**: you are not selling the game only a license to play it some rules.
  * **Rules** (of conduct): detailing what you don’t want them to do with your game (for example, griefing, hacking, uploading malicious code etc). 
  * **Ip rights**: make sure you know and they know that the developer owns the game and that they cannot steal your stuff, 
but maybe you agree that they stream your game on twitch or do gameplays. That should be detailed too with some rules to avoid using it offensively.
  * **User generated content**: who owns what the player creates inside the game.
  * **Virtual currency/items**: if you have them specify that those are not real property, they can be deleted if breaking any rules stated.
  * **Age restrictions**.
  * **Limited liability**: for example that if it’s a multiplayer the servers may not be forever online.

# Intellectual Property:
_(IP)_ Basically involves all aspects of the game.

## Copyright: 

* **Protection** of **fixed expression of ideas** (code, Art, music, animations, characters, Ui design, Writing etc… and you game as a whole).

* It does **not protect abstract ideas/mechanics** , however there’s a type of contract that can be useful for that.

* Generally **if you make something you own it**, but having the copyright registered makes a lot easier/faster proving the work is yours.

* **Contracts may overwrite this general rule** (that’s why they are convenient), so anyone contributing into a game must sign some kind of written agreement that the IP gets transfered/licensed to the studio/developer/entity.

* It gives you exclusive rights:
  * **Reproduction**
  * **Communication**
  * **Distribution**
  * **Rental**
  * **Remuneration**
  * **Public display**
  * **Derivative works**
  
* Those rights **can be licensed to other companies** (by contracts as well).

## Trademark
* **Protection** of Game/Company **names, Logos and Slogans**.

* Exclusive right to be the **only one using your mark or similar for the same goods**, video games in this case.

* Trademark law **prioritizes the first to come** (If you are the first you can stop others afterwards).

* Trademarks **rights are received when you sell/distribute** (includes free games) the **first copy**, not before. Having social media accounts, Webs, good funded kickstarter, articles talking about you/your game or a successful beta; doesn’t give you rights.

* Trademark **don’t need registration** to give you rights, although **registering it upgrades** them. Those rights lasts 10 years in europe.

* There can be a **pre-registration to avoid problems** (for example a game with the same name is published a day before yours). Not registered until you sell.

* Be careful with generic or close to generic names.

* The ™ doesn’t give you anything, works like a signal that you intend to register later.

## Patent

* Novel, useful, non-obvious inventions.

* **VERY EXPENSIVE**.

* **Long** application process.

* **Hard** to enforce.

* **Not relevant** for developers (too much money, efford for not enough warranty).

## Trade Secrets

* **Information** that you keep **secret** and may give you **advantage** because of it.

* For example GDD, Marketing strategies, customer/mailing lists etc.

* How to protect this information:
  * **Limit it’s access.**
  * **Encrypt/secure it.**
  * **Through contacts.** (NDA’s)
  * **Be careful about trade secrets of others that you are not supposed to know.**

## Right of Publicity

* Commercial use of individual name/likeness right (for example using a famous sport star as promototion).

* **Get permission** to use someone’s name.

* Or **parody enough** so you can denial (risky).  

---

# Infringement

## Enforcing Copyright

* There can be cases of cloning, Cracking/piracy , Copied assets…

* There can be other cases like Streaming, Let’s PLays, Fan Arts/Fictions. You may be okay with.

* Copyright lets you choose. Select what is fine and what is not fine, and whenever you decide to. You can specifically enforce.

* Methods to enforce in order of severity:

  1.  **Be sure to have the copyright registered at first.**
  2.  **Work it out.**
  3. **Offer license.** 
  4. **Letter to infringer.**
  5. **DMCA** (Digital Millennium Copyright Ban) **takedown notice to the host** (youtube, steam, play store, etc.).
  6. **Sue** as final and most serious (and expensive) method. 

## Avoid infringing Copyright

* Have in mind the **exceptions** to copyright:
  * **Ideas/Mechanics/Genre**.
  * **Generic concepts**.
  * **Public domain**.
  * **Fair use** (careful). That statement can only be relevant when you are already in court (maybe too late) and stating that you did “fair use” is admitting that you infringed right away. Don’t trust any myths about fair use, every case will be different and decided by a judge.
  
* **Don't use other people stuff**.

# Enforcing Trademark

* Remember you don’t have be registered to be able to enforce.

* Methods:
  1. **Control use.**
  2. **Offer license.**
  3. **Cease and desist letter** (to infringer).
  4. **Takedown request.**
  5. **Sue.**
  
* **The more you enforce, the better** the trademark is (like leveling up, doesn't mean that you have to go behind everyone looking for infringement). 

* **Not enforcing also has its consequences** (you can level down too). 

## Avoid infringing Trademark

* **Google** before you use a name.

* **Get permission** if you want to reference something with trademark.

* **Clear disclaimers** that you do not own the rights if you don’t have/asked permission (taking the risk).

---

# Privacy Policy 

* The **data collected** inside the game (careful with that). 

* **Government enforce privacy issues**.

* Issues/Data breaches can **mess your reputation**.

* You should think of it before launch, at launch and after launch.

* You should have it prior to launch.

* Collect **only the needed data**.

* Have the **privacy policy accessible**. 

* Be **honest** with it.

* Don’t copy it from someone else (You will lie to your users).

* Be compliant to the **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR).

* You should specify: 
  * **Types of data**.
  * **Why collected**.
  * **How used**.
  * **When are they shared and with who**.
  * **How to access user’s data**.
  * **And how is it protected**.

# Summary 
_Some tips to take away_

* **Copyright protects almost all your content, it’s powerful and gives you selective enforcement rights.**

* **Plan, search, register ahead trademarks, and enforce your rights to keep them relevant.**

* **Use contracts, don’t cut corners on them and never sign anything you did not read carefully.**

* **Don’t use other people’s stuff without permission.**

* **Know what you use**

* **Anything doesn’t enforce itself.**
