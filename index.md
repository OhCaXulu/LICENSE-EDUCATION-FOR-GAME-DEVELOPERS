# Introduction

At some point Game Developers will need to ask for a license, will have a contract in their hands, will want to create their own studio, protect their own intellectual properties, etc. I'll try to clarify and give some education about legal issues we may encounter at some point, so we can actually understand a little bit what's going on with the legal side of Game Development.

Companies and why are they useful will be our first topic. The second topic will introduce the most common contracts in our industry. The third topic will be about Intellectual Property (IP). The fourth topic will teach how to handle infringement on Intellectual Property Rights. The Fifth topic will be on Privacy Policies and why are important. Finally we will have a summary with the most important concepts to take away.

# Creating a Company

*By that meaning a legal corporate entity, not a group of people that call themselves a studio.*

A company should be created before you start working/developing anything. IDEALLY (It’s not like you absolutely have to though…). It could wait until you get serious about a project, you start investing money and/or a lot of time (that’s the most common thing to do) It should not be delayed any further than when you start/want/have to work with others.

“A company is sort of like the legal equivalent of a suit of power armor, it protects you and gives you cool abilities” *Chris Reid*
